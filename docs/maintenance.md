# Maintenance Program


## Backup

Backup is the cornerstone of WordPress website management. If an update fails, or your website crashes, it’s imperative to have an up-to-date backup of your website. HRSlab takes the load of your mind by running scheduled backups and making sure that up-to-date backup is always ready. And since our backups are incremental and run off-site, it will successfully back up even the most problematic websites.

Incremental, reliable, comes with off-site storage, and capable of running on an hourly cycle. Everything you need from a great backup.


- [X] Monthly scheduled backup
- [X] Off-site storage
- [X] 1-click restore
- [X] US/EU storage choice
- [X] exclude files and folders
- [X] receive notifications via Email or Slack if your website is down
- [X] on-demand backups
- [X] cloning/migration
- [X] different backup frequencies, from weekly to near real-time (every 1h)
- [X] Download backup to your computer
- [X] exclude as well as include files and folders


::: tip NOTE

Please note that the bundle does not include real time backup, it covers daily and weekly backups only

:::

Our backups also support multisite networks. You can backup, clone and restore your multisite network.

Choose the backup that best suits the needs of your websites.

Your backups are stored for 90 days. If you cancel the contract, backups will be removed after 7 days. If you need to store backups for longer than 90 days, contact us.
